# Upstream Sync Report - January 22, 2026

## Summary
Analysis of 19 commits from `upstream/main` (dyad-sh/dyad) that our fork (`yosiwizman/dyad`) is behind.

**CRITICAL FINDING**: The upstream repository has made extensive branding changes that would **revert all ABBA AI customizations back to Dyad branding**. A full merge is NOT recommended.

## Commit Classification

### ✅ SAFE - Can be cherry-picked (4 commits)
These commits contain bug fixes, tooling improvements, or dependency upgrades with NO branding impact.

| SHA | Title | Files | Rationale |
|-----|-------|-------|-----------|
| `d2aed44` | Add isPro person property to PostHog telemetry (#2285) | `src/hooks/useSettings.ts` | Telemetry improvement, uses existing `hasDyadProKey` helper |
| `23b45a9` | Fix HTML attribute and content escaping for dyad-tags (#2266) | `shared/xmlEscape.ts`, `src/__tests__/xmlEscape.test.ts`, `src/components/chat/DyadMarkdownParser.tsx`, `src/ipc/handlers/chat_stream_handlers.ts`, `src/ipc/utils/dyad_tag_parser.ts`, `src/pro/main/ipc/handlers/local_agent/tools/types.ts`, `src/pro/main/ipc/handlers/local_agent/xml_tool_translator.ts`, e2e snapshots | **IMPORTANT BUG FIX** - Proper XML escaping for tag content |
| `5894cc7` | Upgrade oxlint and enable recommended rules (#2270) | `.oxlintrc.json`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json` | Tooling upgrade only |
| `52e5a3f` | Enable React Compiler (#2259) | `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `vite.renderer.config.mts` | Performance optimization, no branding |

### ⚠️ RISKY - Contains branding/product changes (7 commits)
These commits include branding-related strings or product direction changes that conflict with ABBA.

| SHA | Title | Risk Level | Issue |
|-----|-------|------------|-------|
| `207c919` | Add default chat mode setting (#2244) | HIGH | Contains `isDyadProEnabled` refs and UI changes with Dyad branding |
| `e73bea9` | Add uncommitted files banner with review & commit dialog (#2257) | MEDIUM | New feature - would need ABBA adaptation of text/branding |
| `f44ad71` | feat: enable read-only local agent for pro ask mode (#2260) | HIGH | Contains `enableDyadPro`, `setUpDyadPro`, Dyad Pro references |
| `8377178` | Upgrade Electron and Electron Forge to latest versions (#2258) | LOW | Dependency upgrade but package-lock.json has `"name": "dyad"` changes |

### 🚫 SKIP - Documentation/tooling changes specific to upstream (8 commits)
These are Claude tooling, AGENTS.md, and workflow changes that are either upstream-specific or don't apply to our fork.

| SHA | Title | Reason |
|-----|-------|--------|
| `6c8151a` | prettify AGENTS.md (#2290) | Upstream-specific docs |
| `b888792` | Add pre-commit checks to AGENTS.md (#2287) | Upstream-specific docs |
| `133836b` | Update command for TypeScript type checks (#2286) | Claude commands specific to upstream |

| `560edd7` | Add Claude settings.json with good defaults (#2277) | Upstream Claude config |
| `71812e6` | Prettier claude commands md (#2278) | Upstream Claude config |
| `cdf2f1b` | Update Claude settings and AGENTS.md (#2275) | Upstream Claude config |
| `c2f9978` | Allow #skip-bb as shorthand for #skip-bugbot (#2274) | Upstream CI workflow |
| `e4580ba` | Create e2e-re claude skill (#2273) | Upstream Claude skill |
| `9098570` | Better agents instruction (#2267) | Upstream-specific docs |
| `e229b2a` | Update playwright comment workflow (#2256) | Upstream CI specific |

## Branding Conflict Analysis

The upstream diff shows **massive** branding reversions including:

### URLs Changed (Dyad → ABBA impact)
- `https://www.dyad.sh/` would replace `https://www.abba.ai/`
- `https://academy.dyad.sh/` would replace `https://academy.abba.ai/`
- `https://oauth.dyad.sh/` would replace `https://oauth.abba.ai/`
- `https://api.dyad.sh/` would replace `https://api.abba.ai/`
- `https://engine.dyad.sh/` would replace `https://engine.abba.ai/`
- `https://github.com/dyad-sh/dyad` would replace `https://github.com/yosiwizman/dyad`

### App Identity Changes
- `"name": "dyad"` would replace `"name": "abba-ai"`
- `"productName": "dyad"` would replace `"productName": "ABBA AI"`
- `dyad-apps` directory would replace `abba-ai-apps`
- `dyad://` protocol would replace `abba-ai://`
- `x-scheme-handler/dyad` would replace `x-scheme-handler/abba-ai`

### Removed ABBA-Specific Safeguards
- `verify-no-dyad-branding` script would be removed
- `verify-windows-icon` script would be removed
- `verify-tray-icon-config` script would be removed
- `verify-icon-hashes` script would be removed
- `regenerate-icons` script would be removed
- Windows icon configuration (`setupIcon`, `iconUrl`) would be removed
- Tray icon asset reference would be removed

### UI/Text Changes
- "ABBA AI" → "Dyad" in all user-facing text
- "Made with ABBA AI" → "Made with Dyad"
- All Pro subscription references changed
- Help/support URLs changed

## Recommended Action

### Phase 1: Cherry-pick Safe Commits
1. Create branch: `chore/sync-upstream-20260122`
2. Cherry-pick ONLY these commits:
   - `23b45a9` - XML escaping bug fix (PRIORITY: HIGH)
   - `d2aed44` - PostHog telemetry improvement
   - `5894cc7` - Oxlint upgrade
   - `52e5a3f` - React Compiler

### Phase 2: Manual Port (Future)
Consider manually porting these features with ABBA branding:
- `e73bea9` - Uncommitted files banner (useful feature)
- `207c919` - Default chat mode setting (useful feature)

### Phase 3: Skip
All other commits should be skipped as they are:
- Upstream-specific tooling/docs
- Would cause branding regressions

## Risk Summary

| Category | Count | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Safe to cherry-pick | 4 | ✅ Proceed |
| Risky (needs adaptation) | 4 | ⏳ Manual port later |
| Skip (upstream-specific) | 11 | 🚫 Do not include |

## Verification Checklist
After cherry-picks:
- [ ] `npm run verify-no-dyad-branding` passes
- [ ] `npm run verify-icon-hashes` passes
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes
- [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes
- [ ] `npm run test` passes
- [ ] App builds successfully
- [ ] ABBA branding intact in built app
