# ABBA AI

ABBA AI is a local, open-source AI app builder forked from [Dyad](https://github.com/dyad-sh/dyad). It's fast, private, and fully under your control — like Lovable, v0, or Bolt, but running right on your machine.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡️ **Local**: Fast, private and no lock-in.
- 🛠 **Bring your own keys**: Use your own AI API keys — no vendor lock-in.
- 🖥️ **Cross-platform**: Easy to run on Mac or Windows.

## 🛠️ Contributing

**ABBA AI** is open-source (see License info below).
